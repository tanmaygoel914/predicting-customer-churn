Churn prediction means predicting which customers are at high risk of leaving a company or canceling a subscription to a service, based on their behavior with its product.
## Predicting Customer Churn
This project aims to predict the likelihood of customers churning out from an online website using Data Science.
### Dataset Description
* Each row represents a customer with a unique customer ID and each column has different information about the customer.
* The raw data contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features).
* The columns include different features like demographics, account information, services that they have signed for and churn (customers who left within last month).</br>
### Result
After performing Confusion Matrix and Probability, we are left with two columns:
1. Customer ID
2. Probability of the customer to churn out
